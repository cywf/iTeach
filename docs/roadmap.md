Here's a potential roadmap for the "iTeach" project:

1. Conduct a needs assessment to identify the specific education challenges in Puerto Rico, and the needs of the target population.
    
2. Research and design a comprehensive educational curriculum that can be delivered via the AI companion, with appropriate levels of difficulty and individualization.

3. Develop and test the AI companion software, using cloud computing, machine learning, Terraform, Python, and Rust, and ensuring the companion adheres to the ethical principles outlined.

4. Build out the necessary technology infrastructure to support the AI companion, including servers, databases, and networking.

5. Test and refine the AI companion with real students, getting feedback from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders in the education community.

6. Develop a self-managed learning environment that allows for ongoing improvement and adaption of the AI teaching system, based on student needs and feedback.

7. Partner with local organizations, schools, and community groups to promote the use of the AI companion, and provide resources to support student learning at home.

8. Monitor the impact of the AI companion on student outcomes, and use data analytics to continually improve the system.

9. Expand the program to other communities in Puerto Rico, and potentially other areas in the United States.

10. Continuously refine and update the AI companion to meet the evolving needs of students and the education community.

This roadmap is just an example, and can be adjusted based on the specific goals and resources of your team. It's important to break down the project into smaller tasks to make it more manageable, and to prioritize tasks based on their importance and feasibility.
