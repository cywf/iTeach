A project management system can help keep track of the progress of the iTeach project, and ensure that tasks are completed on time and within budget. Here are some tools and techniques that can be used to create a project management system for the iTeach project:

1. Agile methodology: The Agile methodology can be used to break down the project into smaller tasks and iterations, and prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency. This can help ensure that the project is completed in a timely and efficient manner.

2. Scrum framework: The Scrum framework can be used to organize the project into sprints, each of which is focused on completing a specific set of tasks. This can help keep the team focused and productive, and ensure that progress is being made on the project.

3. Project management software: Project management software such as Trello, Asana, or Jira can be used to track tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress. These tools can also help facilitate collaboration and communication between team members.

4. Regular meetings: Regular meetings can be held to discuss progress on the project, identify any roadblocks or challenges, and plan for upcoming tasks and sprints. These meetings can be held in person or online, depending on the location of team members.

5. Task tracking: Each task should be tracked using a system such as a Kanban board, to ensure that it is completed on time and within budget. This can help identify any potential delays or overruns, and allow for adjustments to be made as needed.

These are just some examples of tools and techniques that can be used to create a project management system for the iTeach project. The specific tools and techniques used will depend on the needs and resources of the team.
