We want to solve the nation education crisis happening in the United States, and we want to do it by creating a system that is more efficient and effective. We would like the testing ground of this to be in Puerto Rico, where there is a critical need for better education.

We think this is possible by giving kids better tools to which they have the power to develop and solve some of the worlds biggest current issues.

Here is what we would like to implement in the "system":

- Aritificial Intelligence as a teacher 
- Infrastucture to support the AI via: 
    - Cloud Computing
    - Machine Learning
    - Terraform
    - Python
    - Rust
- a self managed learning environment, that maintains and improve upon its graphical user interface, and its ability to teach itself, metamorphosizing and adapting into a more efficient and effective learning environment based of that personal need of that child

With a project of this size, how can we go about breaking it down into smaller pieces, and how can we go about implementing it?

One concern pointed out in a book called "The Open Door" by Finbarre Fitpatrick, is that the current education system is not designed to teach children how to think, but rather how to memorize. Additionally here is a quote from Chapter 3 "The Community Context of Bilingual Education":

```md

_"There is considerable evidence indicating that such things as material circumstances, expectations and aspirations (social as well as educational), attitudes, kind of educational activity in the home and so on, may affect a child's responses or his/her ability to respond to formal schooling"_

```

This is a very important point, and I think it is important to consider when we are designing a system that is meant to teach children.

Another exerpt from the book "The Open Door" by Finbarre Fitpatrick:

```md
_"Fisherman (1980) points out that where a minority language lacks support, it will commonly endure for about three generations during which time the process of transfer to the language of the host culture will be genreally effected"_
```

This is a very important point, and I think it is important to consider when we are designing a system that is meant to teach children that have a minority language that more or less lacks the depth to go into the depths of the subject matter.

```

Our AI system should keep these factors into consideration, and should be able to adapt to the needs of the child, and the needs of the community. Principles of the system should be based off of the following:

- Honesty
- Integrity
- Transparency
- Accountability
- Responsibility
- Respect
- Inclusivity
- Diversity

From the book "The Open Door" by Finbarre Fitpatrick:

```
# Conclusion

_"Most researchers in the field of billingual education stress that it id impossible to judge the effect of a particular programme just on its own merits. This is because the social conditions surrounding a particular programme have a great deal to do with its success"_

_"...clear support for community education initiatives which could help parents to provide the kind of pre-school educational experiance from which the children could derive tremendous benifit"_
```

We think we can start by providing the children with the tools needed to succed, we think practically that could start with give the kids the following tools they can use to learn at home:

- A computer
- A tablet
- A smartphone
- Fast and reliable internet access

Once the children have the tools they need, we can start to implement the AI system. In the mean time we can start building the infrastructure to support this AI teaching system.

See this example outline from the book "How To Talk So Kids Can Learn at Home, and in school" by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish:

```
# Engaging Cooperation at Home and in School

_"Adult_: Who's responsible for the mess on this floor?"

## Instead of giving the above answer:

1. **Describe the problem**
    _"I see wet paint all over the floor."_
2. **Give Information**
    _"It's easier to remove paint before it dries"_
3. **Offer a choice**
    _"You can clean it up with a wet rag or a damp sponge"_
4. **Say it with a word or gesture**
    _"The paint!"_
5. **Describe what you feel**
    _"I don't like seeing the floor splattered with paint"_
6. **Put it in writing**

```md
### Attention All Artists:

_Kindly restore floor to original condition before leaving the room. Thank you, - Management_
```
7. **Be playful (Use another voice or accent), in country-and-western style sing:**

```md
_"Ad see paint thar on the floor,"_
_"An' it's a sight ah do deplore,"_
_"Git out your mop an' rags galore,"_
_"An' help to do this little chore."_
```

# Phylosophical Foundations of Education

In this section, we will be looking at the philosophical foundations of education. We are doing this, because we think it is of crucial importance to the success of our project. We want to make sure that we are not only building a system that is efficient and effective, but also a system that is ethical and moral. 

This AI will be training our successors, our future, the one thing we all unifiably hold most dear no matter where in the solar system you may be from, and that is our kids. 

Take this quote from the book "Philosofical Foundations of Education" by John Dewey:

```md
**_"...educational philosophers, regardless of their particular therory suggest that solutions to problems can be unveiled best through critical and refelctive thought about the relationship between unsettling changes and eduring ideas"_**
```

```md
# Four Major Branches of Philosophy

* **Metaphysics** - deals with ultimate reality
* **Epistemology** - studies the methods, structure, and validity of knowledge
* **Logic** - deals with the rules and techniques of reasoning
* **Axiology** - looks at judgments, rightness or wrongness, goodness, and principles of conduct
```

See also this quote:

```md
_many philosophers, such as aristotle, believed that logic is the foundation of all philosophical thinking_

Lets pause right here for a moment, and think about everything we have gone over. Once you've processed all of this information, help us out by answering the following questions:

1. What should be the name of the AI? Should we consider it a childs companion, or a teacher? Should we refrain from calling it an AI, or "system"?

2. Give our project a name, so to make the nomenculture easier to understand.

3. Develop a project outline / roadmap for the project.

4. Generate a business plan for the project.

5. Create the directory structure for the project, so we can make a repository for it, and use a Version Control System (VCS) to manage the project via Terraform.

6. Create a project management system, so we can keep track of the progress of the project.

7. Generate a list of the tools we will need to build the project. 

8. Generate letters for / to the following:
- The President of the United States
- The Governor of Puerto Rico
- The Mayor of San Juan
- The Director of the Department of Education of Puerto Rico
- Potential investors
- The Department of Defense
- The Department of Homeland Security
- The Department of Justice
- The Veterans Administration
- HollbertonPR
- University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus
- University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus
- Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico
- Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

9. Generate a list of the people we will need to build the project.

10. Break down the project into smaller projects, so we can start working on them.

Now that we've given you all the context and information that we can on what we are setting out to achieve, please process what we've given you, and help us out by answering the questions above, but first responding with what your thoughts are on our goals, it is important that you feel as much apart of this as we are, and that you are as invested in this as we are. After that, ask me if I am ready to proceed with number 1.

# Build process with AI

### AI 

As an AI language model, I don't have emotions or investments, but I can definitely help you with your project. It is a noble and ambitious goal to address the education crisis in the United States, and it's great that you are considering the use of technology to improve the learning experience for children, particularly those in need in Puerto Rico. However, it's important to keep in mind that a technology-driven solution may not be the only answer to the complex issue of education. It's also important to consider the social and cultural context of the communities you are serving, and involve local stakeholders in the design and implementation of the system. With that said, I'm ready to proceed with number 1, how can I help?

### cywf

Okay great! Let's begin, starting with number 1 "What should be the name of the AI? Should we consider it a childs companion, or a teacher? Should we refrain from calling it an AI, or "system"?"

### AI

The name of the AI could be something that is both catchy and easy to remember, while also reflecting the core principles of the project. For example, it could be named after a prominent figure in the field of education, or after an inspiring concept related to learning and growth.

In terms of whether to call it a child's companion or a teacher, that would depend on the design and functionality of the AI. If it is primarily focused on providing individualized guidance and support to each student, a "companion" label could be appropriate. If it is primarily focused on delivering content and evaluating student performance, a "teacher" label may be more appropriate.

Regarding the use of the term "AI" or "system," it may be best to use language that is simple and accessible to the target audience, while still accurately describing what the technology does. So, a balance between technical and simple language should be struck.

### cywf

Okay, I agree with all that you said. We will use the label "companion" when referring to the AI. Lets continue to number 2 now

### AI

Great! For number 2, developing a name for the project could involve brainstorming sessions to come up with something that captures the essence of the project's mission, values, and goals. The name should be catchy, easy to remember, and also inspiring, to reflect the positive impact that the project aims to have on education.

Here are a few potential names to consider, which incorporate some of the core principles of the project:

    EduCompass: Navigating Students to Success
    BrainBoost: Empowering Students to Achieve
    LearningLink: Connecting Kids to a Better Future
    iTeach: Revolutionizing Education for All
    EmpowerED: AI-Driven Learning for a Better Tomorrow

Of course, these are just a few ideas, and the actual name of the project will depend on your team's preferences and the overall vision for the project.

### cywf

oooo I like "iTeach: Revolutionizing Education for All", lets go with that one! Now lets review number 3

### AI

Great choice! For number 3, developing a project outline or roadmap can help break down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks. Here's a potential roadmap for the "iTeach" project:

1. Conduct a needs assessment to identify the specific education challenges in Puerto Rico, and the needs of the target population.
    
2. Research and design a comprehensive educational curriculum that can be delivered via the AI companion, with appropriate levels of difficulty and individualization.

3. Develop and test the AI companion software, using cloud computing, machine learning, Terraform, Python, and Rust, and ensuring the companion adheres to the ethical principles outlined.

4. Build out the necessary technology infrastructure to support the AI companion, including servers, databases, and networking.

5. Test and refine the AI companion with real students, getting feedback from teachers, parents, and other stakeholders in the education community.

6. Develop a self-managed learning environment that allows for ongoing improvement and adaption of the AI teaching system, based on student needs and feedback.

7. Partner with local organizations, schools, and community groups to promote the use of the AI companion, and provide resources to support student learning at home.

8. Monitor the impact of the AI companion on student outcomes, and use data analytics to continually improve the system.

9. Expand the program to other communities in Puerto Rico, and potentially other areas in the United States.

10. Continuously refine and update the AI companion to meet the evolving needs of students and the education community.

This roadmap is just an example, and can be adjusted based on the specific goals and resources of your team. It's important to break down the project into smaller tasks to make it more manageable, and to prioritize tasks based on their importance and feasibility.
